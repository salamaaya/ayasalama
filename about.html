          <h3>Unveiling the Story Behind Aya Salama</h3>
          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Aya Salama, a Computer Science major at Stevens
            Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ, with a passion for coding
            and film. I am eager to exploring the dynamic world of technology
            and seek opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in practical
            settings. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my
            experiences and adventures!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="about">
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation
          date of May 2026. Alongside my major, I am also pursuing a minor in
          Cyber Security and specializing in Data Science/Machine Learning.
          Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a diverse range of
          courses that have laid a solid foundation for my technical expertise
          and problem-solving abilities. Some of the key coursework I have
          completed or am currently undertaking includes:
        </p>
        <li>
          Algorithms: This comprehensive curriculum equipped me with a strong
          foundation in algorithm analysis, emphasizing the ability to calculate
          the asymptotic running time of standard algorithms. I grasped the
          significance of big Oh, Theta, and Omega notations, assessing diverse
          algorithms' performance characteristics, while also employing the
          Master Theorem to rigorously prove asymptotic assumptions. Practical
          implementation skills are honed through the creation of graph-based
          algorithms like DFS, BFS, and MST, as well as the comparative analysis
          of basic and advanced sorting techniques. Furthermore, I gained
          hands-on experience in designing and implementing advanced data
          structures, including B-trees, AVL trees, and 2-3 trees, and numerical
          algorithms such as Gauss elimination, binary exponentiation, and the
          simplex method. Algorithm design techniques such as greedy algorithms,
          dynamic programming, hashing, space/time trade-offs, reduction,
          backtracking, and branch-and-bound were explored in depth.
          Additionally, I developed proficiency in crafting comprehensive test
          plans for each assignment, ensuring robust algorithmic solutions,
          using C/C++.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computer Architecture and Organization: In this comprehensive computer
          architecture and programming curriculum, I acquired a deep
          understanding of the essential architectural components like the CPU,
          memory, I/O, storage, and peripherals, setting the foundation for
          computer system comprehension. The course explored advanced topics
          such as parallel computing techniques for high-performance processors
          and delved into the broader context of computer architecture with
          operating systems, networking, distributed systems, and cloud
          computing. Additionally, I gained proficiency in Assembly language
          programming, mastering branching, stack operations, and subroutines
          while navigating development and debugging environments. Finally, I
          advanced my programming skills by learning C, focusing on memory
          management, pointers, and pointer arithmetic, collectively preparing
          me to comprehend, optimize, and work effectively within intricate
          computing environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Structures: This course equipped me with a deep understanding of
          efficient data organization, algorithms, and their implementations,
          allowing me to build robust and scalable software solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discrete Structures: By studying discrete mathematics, I gained
          essential knowledge in logic, set theory, graph theory, and
          combinatorics, which form the basis for solving complex computational
          problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Statistics: I have gained proficiency in statistical analysis,
          hypothesis testing, and probability theory, enabling me to draw
          meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduction to Computer Science: Throughout the course, I gained
          proficiency in fundamental programming techniques, including
          recursion, loops, and conditionals. By applying these skills, I
          successfully developed a Connect Four game and even created a music
          recommendation system.
        </li>
        <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
        <p>
          During my junior year of high school, after relocating from Egypt to
          the United States, I was introduced to the world of programming
          through Java. It was with Java that I discovered my passion for
          coding, igniting a desire to further explore the field. Since then, I
          have continuously enhanced my coding skills in a diverse range of
          languages. Apart from Java, I have developed proficiency in languages
          such as Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Lua, and Racket, as
          well as Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most exciting aspects of being a programmer is the constant
          opportunity to learn. As I embarked on new projects, including the
          creation of this very website, I found myself acquiring new knowledge
          and skills every day. Building this website has provided me with a
          solid foundation in HTML and CSS, expanding my expertise in web
          development. The experience has reinforced my eagerness to embrace new
          technologies and broaden my horizons.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I approach each day with
          enthusiasm and a drive to learn something new. I firmly believe that
          the ever-evolving nature of computer science offers limitless
          possibilities for personal and professional growth. I am excited to
          continue this journey of learning, leveraging my existing skills while
          embracing fresh challenges that come my way.
        </p>
        <h4>Soft Skills</h4>
        <p>
          As I mentioned earlier, I have a strong passion for learning and I am
          always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. In addition to my
          technical abilities, I possess valuable soft skills that contribute to
          my overall effectiveness as a computer science student and future
          professional.
        </p>
        <li>
          Communication: Effective communication is crucial in any collaborative
          environment. I have honed my communication skills through group
          projects, presentations, and participating in coding competitions. I
          am adept at explaining complex technical concepts to both technical
          and non-technical audiences, ensuring smooth and clear communication
          within a team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patience: Patience is an essential quality when it comes to
          problem-solving and debugging code. I have developed the ability to
          remain patient and persistent when faced with challenging programming
          tasks. This enables me to analyze problems thoroughly, troubleshoot
          effectively, and find efficient solutions.
        </li>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I am a proactive learner, always seeking new resources
          and tutorials to expand my knowledge beyond the classroom. I enjoy
          tackling personal coding projects, exploring new programming
          languages, and experimenting with different technologies to broaden my
          skill set. I am eager to apply my skills, contribute to innovative
          projects, and continue my journey of growth and learning in a
