        <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
        <p>
          During my junior year of high school, after relocating from Egypt to
          the United States, I was introduced to the world of programming
          through Java. It was with Java that I discovered my passion for
          coding, igniting a desire to further explore the field. Since then, I
          have continuously enhanced my coding skills in a diverse range of
          languages. Apart from Java, I have developed proficiency in languages
          such as Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Lua, and Racket, as
          well as Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most exciting aspects of being a programmer is the constant
          opportunity to learn. As I embarked on new projects, including the
          creation of this very website, I found myself acquiring new knowledge
          and skills every day. Building this website has provided me with a
          solid foundation in HTML and CSS, expanding my expertise in web
          development. The experience has reinforced my eagerness to embrace new
          technologies and broaden my horizons.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I approach each day with
          enthusiasm and a drive to learn something new. I firmly believe that
          the ever-evolving nature of computer science offers limitless
          possibilities for personal and professional growth. I am excited to
          continue this journey of learning, leveraging my existing skills while
          embracing fresh challenges that come my way.
        </p>
        <h4>Soft Skills</h4>
        <p>
          As I mentioned earlier, I have a strong passion for learning and I am
          always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. In addition to my
          technical abilities, I possess valuable soft skills that contribute to
          my overall effectiveness as a computer science student and future
          professional.
        </p>
        <li>
          Communication: Effective communication is crucial in any collaborative
          environment. I have honed my communication skills through group
          projects, presentations, and participating in coding competitions. I
          am adept at explaining complex technical concepts to both technical
          and non-technical audiences, ensuring smooth and clear communication
          within a team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patience: Patience is an essential quality when it comes to
          problem-solving and debugging code. I have developed the ability to
          remain patient and persistent when faced with challenging programming
          tasks. This enables me to analyze problems thoroughly, troubleshoot
          effectively, and find efficient solutions.
        </li>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I am a proactive learner, always seeking new resources
          and tutorials to expand my knowledge beyond the classroom. I enjoy
          tackling personal coding projects, exploring new programming
          languages, and experimenting with different technologies to broaden my
          skill set. I am eager to apply my skills, contribute to innovative
          projects, and continue my journey of growth and learning in a
          professional setting.
